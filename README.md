# Mavreen's Dotfiles
This project contains the dotfiles and shell scripts I use on my Mac. Thare ese for my personal machine, which is more writing focused and less for coding.

## Installation


### Sublime Text 3
I symlink ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User so Sublime can find it. Overall, it's a light setup. My favored theme and a few packages, mainly.
- Package Control
